In the "UI-UX Hackathon" project, I focused on building a responsive UI for a car rental website. My approach involved designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, ensuring it looks great across various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (from sm to 2xl). I emphasized clean, organized layouts with ample whitespace, especially for larger screens, to avoid clutter. The UI was crafted to be intuitive and interactive, with components like cards, inputs, and forms being fully responsive to enhance the user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
